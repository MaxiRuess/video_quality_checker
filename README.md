**This repo is currently WIP** 

In this streamlit app you can upload videos, checker the quality and convert it into a desired format. 
Currently the app converrt the videos in a predefined _mxf_ format but I am working on a solution that can convert videos in a user defined format.

2. Upload Video in the streamlit app. 
3. Download Video via Download button
